Federalist is an [open source] web publishing platform for the United States federal government. It provides templates for websites, an online editor for maintaining content, and cloud-based infrastructure for high-scale, low-cost website hosting.

The team at [18F] builds and maintains it as a hosted service available to federal government agencies.

Using a site like this, you can host a landing page for a [report](#report),
information about a new program, or ways the public
can [get in touch](#contact).
