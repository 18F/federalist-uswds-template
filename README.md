# This is a Federalist site redirect template

This site is a temporary redirect template, built in Jekyll.

Edit the following information in your `_config.yml` file.

```yml
title: My site
redirect_url: https://18f.gsa.gov
redirect_time: 30
```

This will generate a message that reads:

`My site` has moved to `https://18f.gsa.gov`.
You will be redirected in `30` seconds...

You can also edit the `index.md` file in your pages directory to add additional information.
